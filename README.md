# Android Mod Menu with color animation
I did this for fun since RAUNAK MODS begged me to make it, but he is nice now and helped me out with LinearLayout animation, and I got the idea to do gradient animation by myself. This will not be added to the main project, and will not be maintained much. But feel free to go through the code and copy that into your project

Text animation based on Titanic project https://github.com/romainpiel/Titanic

Menu linearlayout animation is based on GradientDrawable. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/GradientDrawable

`ValueAnimator.ofArgb` is only for Android 5.0 and above

This project is based on mod menu 2.5 https://github.com/LGLTeam/Android-Mod-Menu

Have fun :))
