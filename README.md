# Implementing the menu to the target game

### 1. Know your game's main activity

Now we are looking for main activity, there are 2 ways to do

1. Decompile the game's APK file. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and search after `<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>`.

Example the game's main activity was `com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity`

Be sure to enable Word wrap so it is easier to read

2. APK Easy Tool since it can read out location of main activity without decompiling APK

Note it somewhere to remember it

### 2. Making corresponding changes in the files

Decompile the game APK

Open the game's `AndroidManifest.xml`

Add the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission besides other permissions if it doesn't exist. Doesn't matter where you place it as long as it's above the application tag
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

If you don't add it, you can't allow overlay permission.

Add the service above the end of application tag (change the package name of your menu if you had changed it)
```xml
<service android:name="uk.lgl.modmenu.FloatingModMenuService" android:enabled="true" android:exported="false" android;process=":UnityKillsMe" android:stopWithTask="true"/>
```

Now we need to call your mod menu activity

There are 2 ways to call your mod menu activity. Choose one of them you like to try. Don't know? just choose METHOD 1

**METHOD 1**

This simple way, we will call to `MainActivity.java`. `MainActivity.java` will never be used

Locate to the game's path of main activity and open the **smali** file. If the game have multi dexes, it may be located in smali_classes2.. please check all

With the path of the target gameâ€™s main activity which we determined earlier `com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity`. Think of it like a path `/com/unity3d/player/UnityPlayerActivity.smali`

Open the main acitivity's smali file, search for OnCreate method and paste this code inside (change the package name if you had changed it)
```
invoke-static {p0}, Luk/lgl/MainActivity;->Start(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```

Save the file

**METHOD 2**

You can follow this it if the first method really fails, or if you really want to use `MainActivity.java` for a reason. Since this involve changing activites, it may cause some problems.

On your `MainActivity.java`, put the game's main activity to `public String GameActivity`

![](https://i.imgur.com/jdacwvH.png)

Uncomment this code

```
Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Error. Game's main activity does not exist", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
```

On `AndroidManifest.xml`, remove `<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>` from the game's activity, like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/z1RxPjc.png)

If you don't remove `<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>` from the game's activity, your menu will not launch. `AndroidManifest.xml` can ONLY contain one `<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>`

near the end of application tag `</application>`, add your main activity above it. `uk.lgl.MainActivity` is your main activity

```xml
<activity android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize" android:name="uk.lgl.MainActivity">
     <intent-filter>
         <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
         <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
     </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Save the file

_Do NOT use both methods at the same time_

### 3. Building your project and copying files

Build the project to the APK file.
**Build** -> **Build Bundle(s)/APK(s)** -> **Build APK(s)**

If no errors occured, you did everything right and build will succeded. You will be notified that it build successfully

![](https://i.imgur.com/WpSKV1L.png)

Click on **locate** to show you the location of **build.apk**. It is stored at `(your-project)\app\build\outputs\apk\app-debug.apk`

![](https://i.imgur.com/wBTPSLi.png)

Decompile your **app-debug.apk**.

Copy your mod menu from decompiled app-debug.apk smali to the game's smali folder. Example ours is uk.lgl.modmenu, we copy the `uk` folder from **app-debug** `(app-debug\smali\uk)` to the game's decompiled directory `(game name)\smali`

![](https://i.imgur.com/aO6eEab.png)
 
If the game have multidexes, just add your smali to the last `smali_classes` if possible to prevent compilation errors such as `Unsigned short value out of range: xxxxx` (Smali limit error)

Copy the library file (.so) from **app-debug.apk** to the target game. Watch out the folder names, we don't want to mix them up, so make sure to copy our lib file to the correct architecture. Like our armeabi-v7a lib goes to the target games armeabi-v7a folder, arm64-v8a lib goes to the arm64-v8a folder...

PUTTING THE LIB FILE ON A WRONG ARCHITECTURE LIKE PUTTING ARM64 LIB TO ARMV7 WILL RESULT A CRASH!

### 4. Compiling game apk
 
Now compile and sign the apk, and install it on your device

Congrats. You have successfully implemented a mod menu.
